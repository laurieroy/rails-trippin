# Trippin - A travel planning site -WIP
[demo]()

This site has a list of places (name, photo, zip code) that can be selected to make up a trip (name).

It uses hotwire and stimulus to update and edit the places. 

- Ruby(3.0) on Rails(6.1)
- CSS: Tailwind2	(I had huge issues getting this to work, was eventually saved by [web-crunch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1aTo2I6Dxc))
- DB: postgres 13

The original idea was from Enoch who has the start of a great [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0dyLQkMtm4&t=3328s&ab_channel=Enoch) series. My plan is to build it up similar to my jaunts project.
